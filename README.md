Siftmode
========

RSS News feed gathering and analysis tool.


News websites are fastflowing rivers of information. When you browse a news website you  
     * Get fed information news publishers feel is relevant to the masses
     * Happen to see what was "important news" at the time you visited the website but not necessarily overall for that day
     * Are distracted from the real news by flashing images a big text
     * Read a story, navigate away, and forget about the story and when you read it
     
Siftmode will aim to analyze the words in your selection of RSS news feeds and
     * Display trends in the overall news website group you have selected
     * Compare trends over specific time frames
     * Keep an archive of headlines, descriptions, and links for later retrieval
     * Allow you to specify key words you want to be alerted for

While deep inside I would want to keep this code to myself, maybe build a site with it and fill it with ads, 
I feel if successful, it would eventually be blocked by certain sites. Because of this and the good fuzzy feeling I get
by sharing this I am making it open source. 

Pardon my ignorance of open source licencing. Please feel free to use, modify, and distribute this code.

And now back to coding!
